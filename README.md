# ChatGPT Thread History

* make a RCE Scanner in python that scan on http headers and cookies and parameters and make a rate limit one second and then optimized it and make some options in CLI to choose from and add comments to the code to describe it and don`t depend on payloads but on sleep time

* if the request took more than one second detect it as vulnerable and remove the time.sleep from code and optimized it again

* don`t measure time by get start time and end time but by requests library itself

* try to improve the scanner abilty and add more print functions to see every move in the programme

* add a new arg in with argparse to take the value of limit time variable

* add payloads into the headers to make the website sleep for [limit_rate] and then optimize the code

### The code has some Errors and things must be edited but It`s not so bad deal with
